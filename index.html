        <h2>Addendum: Development Process and Creative Choices</h2>
        <p><strong>Process & Creative Choices:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Setup:</strong> I started by creating the basic structure for the Lights Out game. I chose a 5x5 grid for a balanced level of challenge and manageability.</li>
            <li><strong>Random Configuration:</strong> The board starts white, and random "clicks" are simulated to toggle squares, ensuring the puzzle is solvable upon loading.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS Styling:</strong> The styling focuses on clear visibility of the grid. Squares toggle between black and white when clicked, using smooth transitions.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Logic:</strong> A 2D array is used to track the state of each square. Clicking a square toggles its state and that of its neighboring squares. The game ends when all squares are off.</li>
            <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> One challenge was ensuring the board is always solvable. By simulating clicks on a solved board, I ensure that the game is always winnable.</li>
            <li><strong>Insights:</strong> The process highlighted the importance of structuring game logic effectively. It also demonstrated how to manage event-driven behavior and ensure smooth user interaction.</li>
